Some plugins you may find in this github group. \r\n\r\n\r\n### ClickStarts\r\nClickStarts are pre-built stacks that people can build from - generally they are repos that end with \r\n```\r\n-clickstart\r\n```\r\nSo you can easily spot them. If you want to make your own - fork one that is similar - and go form there. \r\n\r\n### ClickStacks\r\nClickStacks are runtime containers that are used by cloudbees - these are forkable - each one contains instructions on how to use if you want to customise it to your own needs. \r\nThese typically end with \r\n```\r\n-clickstack\r\n```\r\nso you can easily spot them - crazy huh !\r\n\r\n\r\nUse your favourite git or github client.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### The rest?\r\nA hodge podge of utilities and important tools. And perhaps some bad ideas. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAll the cloudbees folks - and others form all over - look at each repo for credits and licences. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nsupport@cloudbees.com - also stackoverflow.com/tags/cloudbees often offers a quick answer. \r\n\r\nyou can reach us on irc \r\n```\r\n#cloudbees on irc.freenode.net\r\n```\r\nThere is also a google group for discussing these projects: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/cloudbees-dev ","name":"OpenSource @ CloudBees","google":""}
