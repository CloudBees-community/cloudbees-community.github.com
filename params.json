Send us a pull request ! \r\n\r\nSee us at http://developer.cloudbees.com\r\n\r\n### Jenkins\r\n\r\nWe are big supporters of Jenkins - this project is hosted over here: http://jenkins-ci.org/ for all your viewing pleasure. Some plugins you may find in this github group. \r\n\r\nIf you have an open source project you want build via Jenkins for free - please to try out https://buildhive.cloudbees.com - all your need is your github account.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ClickStarts - Quick Starts !\r\nClickStarts are pre-built stacks that people can build from - they are repositoryies that have a clickstart.json that defines what repo to clone, what app to run, if there is a database to create etc. They are designed as tools to get people started instantly with the whole stack running on the cloudbees cloud. You can fork them and make them your own, or build new ones from scratch. \r\n```\r\n-clickstart\r\n```\r\nSo you can easily spot them. If you want to make your own - fork one that is similar - and go from there. Send us a pull request if you like. Look for the clickstart.json file in each repo, and be sure to read the readme. \r\n\r\n### Runtime containers\r\nCloudBees has plugin based runtime containers - these are often known as \"clickstacks\". You will use pre-made ones - modified ones - or build your own from scratch - you will find them all here. These are forkable - each one contains instructions on how to use if/develop it you want to customise it to your own needs. \r\n\r\nSome clickstacks/plugins stand alone - some exist to augment others (for example - Newrelic exists to add features to other ones so you get newrelic monitoring !).\r\n\r\nThese typically end with \r\n```\r\n-clickstack\r\n```\r\nso you can easily spot them - crazy huh ! The key file in each clickstack is the \"setup\" script - that is the core of every single one (a clickstack lifestyle involves installing the stack on the platform - and running setup when an application is installed. Setup is responsible for creating the control structure that the platform will use to start each container. Setup is run only once - on each app instance - when an application lands on a server. Typicalyl the setup will write a `.genapp/control/start` script which will start the actual application. You can read more about how things work at a low level here: http://genapp-docs.cloudbees.com/ - and how to get started with your own. \r\n\r\nUse your favourite git or github client and enjoy !\r\n\r\n\r\n### The rest?\r\nA hodge podge of utilities and important tools. And perhaps some bad ideas. No, all good ones, I just checked.\r\n\r\nThere are still some projects located at https://github.com/cloudbees as well.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAll the cloudbees folks - and others form all over - look at each repo for credits and licences. \r\n\r\n### Erlang\r\nA shady character also produces an excellent Erlang framework called e2 http://e2project.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Talk to us\r\nsupport@cloudbees.com - also http://stackoverflow.com/tags/cloudbees often offers a quick answer. \r\n\r\nyou can reach us on irc \r\n```\r\n#cloudbees on irc.freenode.net\r\n```\r\nThere is also a google group for discussing these projects: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/cloudbees-dev - if you are forking something - please to chat about it here as we can help you out.\r\n\r\nKeep up to date on the developer blog http://developer-blog.cloudbees.com\r\n\r\n![CBLogo]\r\n(https://www.cloudbees.com/sites/all/themes/custom/cloudbees_zen/css/bidesign/_ui/images/logo_small.png)\r\n\r\n![Jenkins](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/buildhive-ui/img/jenkins.png)"}
