Send us a pull request ! \r\n\r\nSee us at http://developer.cloudbees.com\r\n\r\n### Jenkins\r\n\r\nWe are big supporters of Jenkins - this project is hosted over here: http://jenkins-ci.org/ for all your viewing pleasure. Some plugins you may find in this github group. \r\n\r\nIf you have an open source project you want build via Jenkins for free - please to try out https://buildhive.cloudbees.com - all your need is your github account.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ClickStarts you will find here\r\nClickStarts are pre-built stacks that people can build from - generally they are repos that end with \r\n```\r\n-clickstart\r\n```\r\nSo you can easily spot them. If you want to make your own - fork one that is similar - and go from there. Send us a pull request if you like.\r\n\r\n### ClickStacks\r\nClickStacks are runtime containers that are used by cloudbees - these are forkable - each one contains instructions on how to use if you want to customise it to your own needs. \r\nThese typically end with \r\n```\r\n-clickstack\r\n```\r\nso you can easily spot them - crazy huh !\r\n\r\n\r\nUse your favourite git or github client and enjoy !\r\n\r\n\r\n### The rest?\r\nA hodge podge of utilities and important tools. And perhaps some bad ideas. \r\n\r\nThere are still some projects located at https://github.com/cloudbees as well.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAll the cloudbees folks - and others form all over - look at each repo for credits and licences. \r\n\r\n### Erlang\r\nA shady character also produces an excellent Erlang framework called e2 http://e2project.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Talk to us\r\nsupport@cloudbees.com - also http://stackoverflow.com/tags/cloudbees often offers a quick answer. \r\n\r\nyou can reach us on irc \r\n```\r\n#cloudbees on irc.freenode.net\r\n```\r\nThere is also a google group for discussing these projects: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/cloudbees-dev - if you are forking something - please to chat about it here as we can help you out.\r\n\r\nKeep up to date on the developer blog http://developer-blog.cloudbees.com\r\n\r\n![CBLogo](https://www.cloudbees.com/sites/all/themes/custom/cloudbees_zen/css/bidesign/_ui/images/logo_small.png)\r\n\r\n![Jenkins](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/buildhive-ui/img/jenkins.png)","name":"OpenSource @ CloudBees","tagline":"cloudbees opensource community","google":""}
