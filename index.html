        <h3>Welcome to CloudBees on github</h3>

<p>At CloudBees we hand craft only the finest open source, artisanally (is that even a word?) whatever. 
This google group contains a lot of our open source - some are functional parts of the system for you to fork and use - others are just libraries that we use and you hope you find useful. </p>

<h3>Jenkins</h3>

<p>We are big supporters of Jenkins - this project is hosted over here: <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">http://jenkins-ci.org/</a> for all your viewing pleasure. Some plugins you may find in this github group. </p>

<h3>ClickStarts</h3>

<p>ClickStarts are pre-built stacks that people can build from - generally they are repos that end with </p>

<pre><code>-clickstart
</code></pre>

<p>So you can easily spot them. If you want to make your own - fork one that is similar - and go form there. </p>

<h3>ClickStacks</h3>

<p>ClickStacks are runtime containers that are used by cloudbees - these are forkable - each one contains instructions on how to use if you want to customise it to your own needs. 
These typically end with </p>

<pre><code>-clickstack
</code></pre>

<p>so you can easily spot them - crazy huh !</p>

<p>Use your favourite git or github client.</p>

<h3>The rest?</h3>

<p>A hodge podge of utilities and important tools. And perhaps some bad ideas. </p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>All the cloudbees folks - and others form all over - look at each repo for credits and licences. </p>

<h3>Support or Contact</h3>

<p><a href="mailto:support@cloudbees.com">support@cloudbees.com</a> - also stackoverflow.com/tags/cloudbees often offers a quick answer. </p>
