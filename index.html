        <h3>Welcome to CloudBees on github</h3>

<p>At CloudBees we hand craft only the finest open source, artisanally (is that even a word?). </p>

<p>This github group contains the open source bits that make up the CloudBees platform - many are core parts of the system for you to fork and use - others are libraries/utilities that we use and hope you find useful. Send us a pull request ! </p>

<p>See us at <a href="http://developer.cloudbees.com">http://developer.cloudbees.com</a></p>

<h3>JENKINS CI</h3>

<p>We are big supporters of Jenkins - this project is hosted over here: <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">http://jenkins-ci.org/</a> for all your viewing pleasure. Some plugins you may find in this github group. We support many FOSS projects by providing free build infrastructure - if you have an interesting project - let us know so we can help!</p>

<p>If you have an open source project in github and you want to build via Jenkins for free - please to try out <a href="https://buildhive.cloudbees.com">https://buildhive.cloudbees.com</a> - all your need is your github account.</p>

<h3>ClickStarts - Quick Starts !</h3>

<p>ClickStarts are pre-built stacks that people can build from - they are repositories that have a clickstart.json that defines what repo to clone, what app to run, if there is a database to create etc. They are designed as tools to get people started instantly with the whole stack running on the cloudbees cloud. You can fork them and make them your own, or build new ones from scratch. Look for projects postfixed with:</p>

<pre><code>-clickstart
</code></pre>

<p>In the name, so you can easily spot them (they also have a clickstart.json file - which is the interesting bit). If you want to make your own - fork one that is similar - and go from there. Send us a pull request if you like. Look for the clickstart.json file in each repo, and be sure to read the readme. </p>

<h3>RUNTIME CONTAINERS</h3>

<p>CloudBees has plugin based runtime containers - these are often known as "clickstacks". You will use pre-made ones - modified ones - or build your own from scratch - you will find them all here. These are forkable - each one contains instructions on how to use if/develop it you want to customise it to your own needs. </p>

<p>Some clickstacks/plugins stand alone - some exist to augment others (for example - Newrelic exists to add features to other ones so you get newrelic monitoring !).</p>

<p>These typically end with </p>

<pre><code>-clickstack
</code></pre>

<p>so you can easily spot them - crazy huh ! The key file in each clickstack is the "setup" script - that is the core of every single one (a clickstack lifestyle involves installing the stack on the platform - and running setup when an application is installed. Setup is responsible for creating the control structure that the platform will use to start each container. Setup is run only once - on each app instance - when an application lands on a server. Typically the setup will write a <code>.genapp/control/start</code> script which will start the actual application. </p>

<h4>Complete guide for Stacks</h4>

<p>Here is a complete guide to getting going with your own stack: <a href="http://wiki.cloudbees.com/bin/view/RUN/DevelopingStacks">http://wiki.cloudbees.com/bin/view/RUN/DevelopingStacks</a></p>

<h4>10 minute quick start</h4>

<p>Here is a 10 minute tutorial: <a href="http://developer-blog.cloudbees.com/2012/12/make-your-own-runtime-in-10-minutes-or.html">http://developer-blog.cloudbees.com/2012/12/make-your-own-runtime-in-10-minutes-or.html</a> that will take you through building one.</p>

<h3>GENAPP</h3>

<p>Genapp is our open source utility that is the "kernel" of the paas - you can read more about how things work at a low level here: <a href="http://genapp-docs.cloudbees.com/">http://genapp-docs.cloudbees.com/</a> - and how to get started with your own. 
The source code for genapp is here: <a href="https://github.com/cloudbees/genapp">https://github.com/cloudbees/genapp</a></p>

<p>Use your favourite git or github client and enjoy !
(git command line, github client, or source tree are the popular ones)</p>

<h3>The rest?</h3>

<p>A hodge podge of utilities and important tools. And perhaps some bad ideas. No, all good ones, I just checked.</p>

<p>There are still some projects located at <a href="https://github.com/cloudbees">https://github.com/cloudbees</a> as well.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>All the cloudbees folks - and others form all over - look at each repo for credits and licences. </p>

<h3>Erlang</h3>

<p>A shady character also produces an excellent Erlang framework called e2 <a href="http://e2project.org/">http://e2project.org/</a></p>
