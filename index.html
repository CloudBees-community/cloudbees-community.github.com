        <h3>Welcome to CloudBees on github</h3>

<p>At CloudBees we hand craft only the finest open source, artisanally (is that even a word?). 
This GitHub group contains a lot of our open source projects. Some are functional parts of the system for you to fork and use; others are libraries/utilities that we use and hope you find useful. Send us a pull request!</p>

<p>See us at <a href="http://developer.cloudbees.com/">developer.cloudbees.com</a></p>

<h3>Jenkins</h3>

<p>We are big supporters of Jenkins. This project is hosted at <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">jenkins-ci.org</a> for all your viewing pleasure. Some plugins may be found in this GitHub group.</p>

<p>If you have an open-source project you want build via Jenkins for free, please try out <a href="https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/">buildhive.cloudbees.com</a>—all your need is your GitHub account.</p>

<h3>ClickStarts you will find here</h3>

<p>ClickStarts are pre-built stacks that people can build from. Generally they are repos that end with <code>-clickstart</code>
so you can easily spot them. If you want to make your own, fork one that is similar and go from there. Send us a pull request if you like.</p>

<h3>ClickStacks</h3>

<p>ClickStacks are runtime containers that are used by CloudBees. These are forkable—each one contains usage instructions if you want to customise it to your own needs. 
These typically end with <code>-clickstack</code>
so you can easily spot them—crazy huh!</p>

<p>Use your favourite Git or GitHub client and enjoy!</p>

<h3>The rest?</h3>

<p>A hodge podge of utilities and important tools. And perhaps some bad ideas.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>All the CloudBees folks, and others from all over—look at each repo for credits and licences.</p>

<h3>Erlang</h3>

<p>A shady character also produces an excellent Erlang framework called e2: <a href="http://e2project.org/">e2project.org</a></p>

<h3>Talk to us</h3>
